A simple example of a scrollable image grid using Material UI in ReactJS. We had a requirement for a scrollable image grid which will load images lazily. We started with the [Grid List](https://material-ui.com/components/grid-list/) example provided in Material UI.

We added a few more capabilities
- Load images lazily
- On clicking the tile, display image dialog
- Download option on image dialog
